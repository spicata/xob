> great to see what interpretations of xobs other people create. ...actually, it's kind of terrifying. also, stop using our calls to cook. - m.spicata

> based on a true story, this "xob" comic shows the tragedy of technology and what it has done to our youths. it shows a person playing a silly video game for 24 hours, wasting his life away. also impostor at the top in katakana - notmario

> The artwork “The Layered” is a piece inspired by traditional and modernistic artistic identities, and aims to blend drawing styles from various movements to create a fresh twist on the classical xob story. Reminiscent of the incredible detail to scenery and perspective in the style made famous by the renowned artist Edward Hopper, “The Layered” creates a unity with its 4 panel design and unity in terms of character casts. Traditional xob comics followed such similar format, with main differences being the more straighter panel lines, rather than the stylistic more messy brush strokes seen in this interpretation. Facial expressions, or the lack of them, are a staple to the xob franchise, and looking back at this artwork, the use of facial expressions detracts from the overall message of the artwork. The story at hand tells of a young protagonist, excited to play the game “Chef Showdown” whilst deafened and muted and his journey throughout the depths of his culinary journey. The impact this story had on me was immense, such I was inspired to make my own artistic interpretation of the image. To reflect, there are three things that I would do instead of I have the opportunity to partake in such event again - 1. Inconsistency, particularly the red table in the first panel and black in the others, also the thought bubble small circles should be coloured in, rather than white - 2 - straighter panels (Which I talked about earlier, as this is one of the core staples for all successful xob comics - instead of replacing it, it would’ve been much better to add on or to subvert typical audience expectations with what an xob comic contains. Overall, it was a fun experience and I’d like to take a moment to thank my fans, friends and family for supporting my journey, and of course the other participants Joel, notmario, Loren, M.spicata and of course Dasindu :heart: - nottacoz
